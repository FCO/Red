DESCRIPTION
-----------

Red is a *WiP* ORM for perl6. It’s not working yet. My objective publishing is only ask for help validating the APIs.

### traits

  * `is column`

  * `is column{}`

  * `is id`

  * `is id{}`

  * `is serial`

  * `is referencing{}`

  * `is relationship{}`

  * `is table<>`

  * `is nullable`

### features:

#### relationships

Red will infer relationship data if you use type constraints on your properties.

```perl6
# Single file e.g. Schema.pm6

model Related { ... }


# belongs to
model MyModel {
    has Int     $!related-id is referencing{ Related.id };
    has Related $.related    is relationship{ .id };
}

# has one/has many
model Related {
    has Int $.id is serial;
    has MyModel @.my-models is relationship{ .related-id };
}
```

If you want to put your schema into multiple files, you can create an "indirect" relationship, and Red will look up the related models as necessary.

```perl6
# MyModel.pm6
model MyModel {
    has Int     $!related-id is referencing{ :model<Related>, :column<id> };
    has         $.related    is relationship({ .id }, :model<Related>);
}

# Related.pm6
model Related {
    has Int $.id is serial;
    has     @.my-models is relationship({ .related-id }, :model<MyModel>);
}
```

If Red can’t find where your `model` is defined you can override where it looks with `require`:

```perl6
    has Int     $!related-id is referencing{ :model<Related>, :column<id>,
                                             :require<MyApp::Schema::Related> };
```

#### custom table name

```perl6
model MyModel is table<custom_table_name> {}
```

#### not nullable columns by default

Red, by default, has not nullable columns, to change it:

```perl6
#| This makes this model’s columns nullable by default
model MyModel is nullable {
    has Int $.col1 is column;               #= this column is nullable
    has Int $.col2 is column{ :!nullable }; #= this one is not nullable
}
```

#### load object from database

```perl6
MyModel.^load: 42;
MyModel.^load: id => 42;
```

#### save object on the database

```perl6
$object.^save;
```

#### search for a list of object

```perl6
Question.^all.grep: { .answer == 42 }; # returns a result seq
```

#### phasers

  * `before-create`

  * `after-create`

  * `before-update`

  * `after-update`

  * `before-delete`

  * `after-delete`

#### Temporary table

```perl6
model Bla is temp { ... }
```

#### Create table

```perl6
Question.^create-table;
Question.^create-table: :if-not-exists;
Question.^create-table: :unless-exists;
```

#### IN

```perl6
Question.^all.grep: *.answer ⊂ (3.14, 13, 42)
```

#### create

```perl6
Post.^create: :body("bla ble bli blo blu"), :title("qwer");


model Tree {
    has UInt   $!id        is id;
    has Str    $.value     is column;
    has UInt   $!parent-id is referencing{ Tree.id };

    has Tree   $.parent    is relationship{ .parent-id };
    has Tree   @.kids      is relationship{ .parent-id };
}

Tree.^create-table: :if-not-exists;

Tree.^create:
    :value<Bla>,
    :parent{:value<Ble>},
    :kids[
        {:value<Bli>},
        {:value<Blo>},
        {:value<Blu>}
    ]
;
```
