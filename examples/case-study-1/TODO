Items or features to be done:

+ Use a grammar for extracting CSV input data

+ Create tests from the scripts

+ Create another table that maps a unique but complex string key to a
  simpler string to be used as the registration number (ID) for a
  person. Such an ID would be easy to say and remember for
  registration and other external purposes. For example, we make the
  original, permanent key by joining '|last|first|email1|...|emalN|'
  and map it to something like 'CTnnnn' where 'n' is a digit.
